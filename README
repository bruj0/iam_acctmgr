aws_acctmgr
===========

``aws_acctmgr`` synchronizes a local NSS database against Amazon Web Services
(AWS) Identity and Access Management (IAM) with the primary use-case of
providing SSH access to AWS EC2 instances for remote administrators.

This relies on the SSH Public Key metadata feature added to AWS IAM.
Note that the AWS documentation currently only mentions this feature in the
context of the AWS CodeCommit product but the API naming itself has no such
context.

See:
    https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_GetSSHPublicKey.html
    https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_ListSSHPublicKeys.html


Features:

* UID derived by the IAM UserID property, users will always have the same UID across
all the intances

* IAM groups for Sudo users and regular users.

* Automatic creation of users home directory using the skel profile.

* Local groups support

IAM users are not added to the system via traditional mechanisms (e.g.
``/etc/passwd``).  Instead they are registered in a dedicated directory
provided by the "libnss-extrausers" package.  The host's ``/etc/nsswitch``
should have ``extrausers`` appended to the ``passwd`` and ``shadow`` entries.

    passwd:         compat extrausers
    group:          compat extrausers
    shadow:         compat extrausers
